# RecyclerView Implementation

The project purpose is to practice the recyclerview implementation with AsyncListDiffer
Branches:
  - simple-implementation - single viewholder in one adapter
  - master - three viewholders with different models in one adapter

# About

The app implements MVVM architecture and uses ```https://jsonplaceholder.typicode.com/``` API to get the data.
The user is able to scroll through all the users, click on them to get a list of albums and then get a list of photos that belongs to these albums.
The adapter uses **AsyncListDiffer** for better performance.
